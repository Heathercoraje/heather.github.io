	<h1><strong>Hello World !</strong></h1>
	<p class="intro"><strong>People I've Met</strong>
		is a personal project to keep record of special people I meet in this trip I call life.
		To me, traveling has been the most effective tool in journey to find my desire, happinesss and eventually myself.
		Along the way, I have met amazing individuals from all around the world who have taught me invaluable lessons, not by words but by being who they are.
		As I come from geologically-isolated and a small country, witnessing happy people with distinct lifestyles has truly encouraged
		me to accept who I am and to never stop looking for vision of my life. As I am a psychology nerd, I plan to integrate relevant theories within
		each story and eventually publish this project as a book. I hightlight key values I bear in mind from each experience with #hashTag. <br />
		<br />
		<strong>TL:DR;<strong> it is a tribute page for my friends around the world. <br /><strong>Enjoy my project!</strong></p>
