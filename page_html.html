		<p class="p2"><strong>People I've Met(aka PIM)</strong> is a personal project to keep record of special people I meet while traveling. I plan to publish a book later when rignt time comes. They are people who have given me new inspiration and different ways to interpret life while traveling 27 countries so far. I had eye-opening experience with these friends. They have taught me invaluable lessons, not by their words but their lifestyles. As I come from geologically-isolated and a small country, witnessing a fair amount of happy people with distinct lifestyle has truely encouraged me to accept who I am and to never stop looking for vision of my life. Below each picture, I hightlight key values I bear in mind from experience with each individual. So, it is a tribute page for my friends around the world. <br /><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
