Dear all,

Hi, I am Heather. I come from South Korea, a homogeneous nation based on a strong sense of collectivism.
According to Developmental Psychology, one can't conceptualize a new idea or sensation if the equivalent does not exist in her own culture because she fails to find a verbal match, a word, to describe the new concept. Because a language is formed reflecting common value system of each country.

In this regard, being able to speak English and Spanish led me to discover a variety of values as I was not bound to my own culture anymore.
I started backpacking since 14. I traveled to 27 countries so far. I was impressed by wonderful historical sites but people I have met while traveling practically had me break and recreate the frame I look at my life. Traveling and sharing thoughts with people around the world had me liberated and encouraged me to create myself by reconnecting to myself.
In this project, I keep records of my friends who inspires me and awakens me by sharing their visions in life.

<strong>TL;DR</strong>, 'People I've Met' is a tribute project for my friends around the world. Later days, I will publish a book out of the project with hope to be an inspiration to another individual.
