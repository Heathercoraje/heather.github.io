Final project for FAC
This is a final project of building a simple one-page website for Founders and Coders.

Since it is upto me to choose a topic, I've decided to introduce my friends I have meet while traveling about the world.
I am born very social. On top of this, I always have been fasincated by how people interact with each other in different social context, I even majored in psychology. The personality I have helps me tremendously when it comes to meeting new people.

//it's all about creating something awesome. It does not matter in which format. 

Title: We Are United in Our Difference 

Hi, I am Heather. I come from South Korea, a homogeneous nation based on a strong sense of collectivism.
I was first connected to another part of the world through music of Westlife, Backstreet boys and Avril Lavine at the age of 10.
Due to the geological factor, the presence of N.Korea and the fact that the language Korean is only valid in Korea, it was not until I moved to Austrailia at the age of 12 that I started to understand there are many different ways to live a life.

According to Developmental Psychology, one can't conceptualize a new idea/new sensation/new object into a word if such thing does not exist in their home culture because she/he fails to find a verbal match,a word, to describe this new concept. Because a language is formed reflecting common value system of each country. For example, in English speaking countries, 'I' is the word most frequently used in a sentence while 'us' is for many Asian countries. In this regard, being able to speak English led me to understand new ways to interpret the world, not only I was no longer limited to read just in Korean, also I could talk with anybody from another part of the world and share thoughts. It freed my mind completely and encouraged me to be who I am by creating my identity instead of finding a common lifestyle and squeeze myself into it.

I started backpacking since 14. I traveled to 27 countries so far. I was impressed by wonderful historial sites but people I have met while traveling impressed me more. In fact some of them practically have changed how I see life now. In this project, I want to introduce my friends who have inspired me, awaken me and show me visions in life.
