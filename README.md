<h1><strong>People I've Met</strong></h1>

This is a final project of building a simple one-page website for Founders and Coders.

Dear all, 

Hi, I am Heather. I come from South Korea, a homogeneous nation based on a strong sense of collectivism.
I was first connected to other parts of the world through music of Westlife, Backstreet Boys and Avril Lavigne at the age of 10.
Due to the geological factor, the presence of N.Korea and the fact that the language Korean is only valid in Korea, it was not until I moved to Austrailia at the age of 12 that I started to understand there are many different ways to live a life.

According to Developmental Psychology, one can't conceptualize a new idea/new sensation/new object into a word if such thing does not exist in their home culture because she/he fails to find a verbal match, a word, to describe this new concept. Because a language is formed reflecting common value system of each country. For example, in English speaking countries, 'I' is the word most frequently used in a sentence while 'us' is for many Asian countries. 

In this regard, being able to speak English led me to discover a variety of values to pursue in life, other than money or fame because I was no longer limited to Korean media or books to read. Instead I could share thoughts with anybody from other parts of the world. It freed my mind completely and encouraged me to be who I am by creating my identity instead of finding a common lifestyle and squeeze myself into it. 

I started backpacking since 14. I traveled to 27 countries so far. I was impressed by wonderful historial sites but people I have met while traveling impressed me more. In fact some of them practically have changed how I see life now. In this project, I want to introduce my friends who have inspired me, awakened me through sharing their visions in life. 

<strong>tl;dr</strong>, 'People I've Met' is a tribute project for my friends around the world for coloring my life with millions of colors. With the lessons I learnt on the road, I have become brave to question what is always accepted as a 'Good life'. Later, I would like to publish a book out of the project so that young generation of my country can feel less anxious about to want different elements in life.
