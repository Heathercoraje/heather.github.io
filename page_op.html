           <h5>Tiger</h5> 
          <img class="pic" src="https://s7.postimg.org/qu3v8byij/tiger.jpg"/>


          <p><strong> Born to Lose, Live to Win</strong><br />
          I met Tinger in Spain, 2013. His motivationas are Rock N Roll & Mongol spirit. His story gives a motivation to chase after what makes me happy rather than what pleases society or other people. #Integrity # Honesty #Fearless

       		<p><strong>Reality is Where You Choose</strong><br />
            Pablo was a dear roommate. He took me to a wonderful hippie town where I was connected to people with full of soul. He often disconects himself from all electronic devices to re-activate connection with the nature. #Nature  #Viability</p>

       		<p><strong>Mjau, I Love Cat</strong><br /> 
            Rebecca loves fat kittens. I met Rebecca in Paraguay. With her, I acknowledged a true friendship can be built regardless of age, color and nationality. We have done fruit tattoos . I love her strategies to disagree politely. #Honesty #Connection

          <p><strong>It Doesn't Matter Even If We Fail</strong><br />I met Rafa in Thailand in 2015. He is very self-motivated and persistent. He has taught me the importance of trusting the process. He virtually held my head when I was going through the darkest time over Skype. #Harshlove #Persistence

         <p>Fatma was born in Cappadocia. She is a preschool teacher and her passion is children's love. I visited her hometown in 2014. I was invited to a tradiontional Turkish wedding and religious events where I learnt about Muslim without prejudice. #Angelalive #Generosity</p>

         <p><strong>Young Entrepreneur</strong><br />
          I met Kimmy in Vietnam in 2015. Kimmy has recently started to work independently by building her own tour company. Her passion is to promote the beauty of Vietnames culture and history in respectful way. #Independency</p>

         <img class="pic" src="https://s16.postimg.org/3vnx60c11/image.jpg"/>
         <p><strong>This Crazy Dude</strong><br />
          DK traveled across Europe and Africa on motobike from Russia for 10 months. He traveled 33 countries and 3 different continents. He inspired me for his bold life decision and wide network of friends around the world. #Boldness

         <img class="pic" src="https://s4.postimg.org/fqr8tdie5/Gambas.jpg"/>
         <p><strong>True Backpacker</strong><br />
          Gabriel tries to understand history, local culture and social context of each country he travels too. Though he is from a different continent, his knowledge of Asian countries he traveled was surprisingly deep. #Attitudewhentraveling </p>

         <p><strong>2017 Life-Changing Year </strong><br />
         Sindy is backpacking for a year. She became a special friend as we both were traveling for a momentum to start a new life. I love her straightforwardness in communication and open-minded personality to learn from anyone. #Foreveryoung
